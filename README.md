# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

This project explores and visualizes the progression of COVID-19 cases worldwide using Python. It includes data preprocessing, aggregation, and visualization techniques to present insightful trends.

## Features
- Data preprocessing:
  - Removal of unnecessary columns.
  - Renaming columns for clarity.
  - Handling missing values using Scikit-learn's `SimpleImputer`.
- Grouping and aggregating data by country and date.
- Visualizations:
  - Scatter plots showing trends for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
  - Global trends and individual country-level trends over time.

## Technologies and Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing with `SimpleImputer`.
